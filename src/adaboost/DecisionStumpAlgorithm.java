 * A decision stump is a machine learning model consisting of a one-level decision tree.
 * That is, it is a decision tree with one internal node (the root) which is immediately connected to the terminal nodes (its leaves).
 * A decision stump makes a prediction based on the value of just a single input feature. Sometimes they are also called 1-rules
